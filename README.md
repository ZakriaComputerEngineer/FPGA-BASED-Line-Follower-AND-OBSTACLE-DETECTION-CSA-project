# Line-Follower-CSA-project
Line follower and Obstacle detection on FPGA board, a COMPUTER SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE PROJECT coded completely in Verilog (HDL) on Xilinx Design Suit
Read the report for complete explanation!

Summary: simple project based on an arduino line follower + obstacle detection with three different speed option. car is based on 2 gear motor one castor wheel chasis with L298N H-bridge dual channel motor driver. board used here is: Spartan 6 FPGA borad. three IR sensors (one for front facing obstacle detection, two for line detection) PWM signal generated for speed adjustment and turning effect, coded on verilog (Xilinx Design Suite)
